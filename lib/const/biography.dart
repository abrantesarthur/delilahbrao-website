    "Delilah Brao is that girl you can’t really figure out. You like her, but you don’t know why. She's elusive. She's complicated. Sometimes, she feels like a walking contradiction. You love that about her. In her debut EP, Since You’re In New York, Delilah ruminates on long distance relationships, heartbreak and starting over. Produced by Justin Lucas (Khalid, The Revivalists, Alec Benjamin, Wafia) and mixed by Philip Etherington (Lizzy McAlpine, FINNEAS, Laufey, Tiny Habits), this folk-pop EP is sparsely and delicately produced to showcase Delilah’s moving songwriting and ethereal vocals. She's singing about herself, and you, and it's still somehow out of reach. Delilah is from Boston, MA and is based in Los Angeles, CA. She has collaborated with notable writers such as DJ Sabrina The Teenage DJ (credits with The 1975), lewloh, and Josh Polack (formerly Mom Rock). Delilah’s music has been praised in Paper Magazine, Stereo Fox, CULTR and more.";
